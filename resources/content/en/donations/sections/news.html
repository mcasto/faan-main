    Double Your Impact for the Dogs of Ecuador
  </div>
  <p>
    A $20,000 double-matching grant has been announced by <a href='https://www.facebook.com/familiaamoranimal'
      target='_blank'>Fundaci√≥n FAAN</a>'s mystery donor.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is our generous donor's holiday gift:
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Every donation you make through the end of January will be matched for the dogs of FAAN as we race to build them
      the most modern animal shelter in Ecuador.
    </p>
    <p>
    <div class='text-lg text-gray-600'>Why Now?</div>
    We bought the land, and now it's time to build, so we can move our dogs, while we focus on the prize of population
    prevention through the spaying and neutering of Cuenca's street dogs and community education.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you in advance for your animal-loving generosity this holiday season. Every donation, no matter the
      amount, will be doubled to help us get to our goal of $40,000 raised by the end of January.
