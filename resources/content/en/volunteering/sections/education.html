    FAAN Focuses on Animal Welfare through Education
  </div>
  <p>
    FAAN volunteers have begun the work on developing an education program and
    curriculum on animal welfare in Ecuador. The program will target early grade
    education as well as key point of influence in animal welfare within
    communities including veterinarians, pet stores and youth groups.
  </p>
  <p>
    By developing young people’s knowledge about animals, we can inspire the
    next generation and create a future that’s kinder to animals.
  </p>
  <p>
    91% of adults polled said young people should be taught kindness to animals
    at school.
