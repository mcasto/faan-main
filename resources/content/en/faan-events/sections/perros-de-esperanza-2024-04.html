          If you think your dog would qualify to be a Perro de Esperanza, drop
          us
          a line and photo of your pup and tell us a little bit about them. We
          have an agreement to bring dogs and their owners into Cuenca Hospital
          to
          spread Big Dog Love.

          A vetting of dogs will be held on Saturday, May 4th at Parque de La
          Madre at 10 AM. During this trial, we will test your pup for basic
          commands and reaction to different people and environments.
