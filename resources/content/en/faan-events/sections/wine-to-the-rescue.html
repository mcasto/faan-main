      Yes, your Best Friend could be Ecuador’s Best-Selling Wine Label this Holiday! Just submit a picture of your dog
      on your
      favorite social media or send us a photo at info@FAANecuador.org by November 25th and guess what? Your dog could
      have
      their own private label wine. How cool is that?

      Our friends at Cosecha have generously partnered with us to present a private-label Chardonnay and Cabernet
      Sauvignon for FAAN to benefit the building of FAAN’s new animal shelter this holiday season.
