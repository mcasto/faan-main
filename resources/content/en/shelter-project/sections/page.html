      Keeping Animals Safe in Cuenca, Ecuador
    </div>

    <p>
      We did it! We raised funds to purchase permanent land for the dogs of FAAN who were facing eviction. We are now
      entering
      building construction so that our dogs will have a safe and modern sanctuary that, hand in hand with education,
      prevention, and adoption, will make a real difference in Cuenca's care and kindness for abandoned, rescued, and
      vulnerable
      dogs.
