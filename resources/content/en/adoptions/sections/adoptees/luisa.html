  <div class="description">
    I am a calm lady, about seven years old, who had a rough past. I used to
    fear people a lot, and still don't like a leash, but have started to trust a
    little more. I am very docile with other dogs and enjoy their company. If
    the other dogs are with me, I will come up to you and let you pet me even if
    I don't know you yet. I am anxious of brooms, which might be because I was
    beaten with them before being rescued. My owner will have to be patient in
    order to give me time to trust them, but as soon as I get used to my new
    surroundings and feel comfortable, I would also make a great family dog,
    since I am very patient and loving.
