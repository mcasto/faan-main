  <div class='description'>I am a young, female dog and live with my mother, Ambar, in the shelter. I am very shy and
    need to be approached slowly and with caution since fast movements scare me. Sometimes my curious side
    comes out, and I'll enjoy your attention then. I also like mingling and
    making friends with other dogs. That's why, sometimes, you can find me in a different cuarto of the
    shelter. Normally I stay behind the more confident dogs, but when I'm alone with you, and you've earned
    my trust, you can count on me as a loyal and friendly companion who gets along well with other dogs.</div>
