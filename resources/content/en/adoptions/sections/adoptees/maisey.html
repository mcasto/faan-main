  <div class="description">
    I am a six-year-old, medium-sized dog whose former owner found me abandoned
    by my mother. At my old home, I was cared for very well and grew up to be a
    really sweet and friendly dog, but, sadly, my owner had to return to the
    United States and couldn't take me with them. My breed is a unique mixture
    of Poodle and Terrier, but I also have Border Collie-like features. Since I
    have been growing up and living with other dogs all my life, I am social and
    get along well with both kids and other animals. Currently I am living with
    my best friend, Sophie, with whom I have a strong bond. I'm a great
    companion to her, even though I am the more shy one of the two of us. Both
    of us being adopted to the same home isn't required, but would sure help us
    settle into our new home and get accustomed faster. I am very calm and
    loving and will fit into any family. I am also spayed, vaccinated, and
    housebroken. This is a wonderful adoption for an instant companion and
    loving, best friend for the family, particularly if you are not looking
    forward to training a puppy. If you live within 4 hours of Cuenca, we will
    bring Sophie and/or Maisey to you as part of FAAN's adoption support for
    these two special girls.
