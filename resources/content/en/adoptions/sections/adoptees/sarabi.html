  <div class='description'>If you are looking for a dog who resembles a cleaning mop, this little energy bundle is
    perfect for you.
    I will always come running with little waddles as soon as I hear someone
    arriving, and I love attention. Some dogs don't get along well with my energy, but with my best friend
    at the shelter, Pastora, I always have a great time. My food is holy to me, so as soon as I receive
    it, I will guard it with my life, and even when I'm not hungry anymore, I will stay by it to make sure
    nobody steals it from me. With my advanced age, I enjoy relaxing and lying down, but most of the time
    I have the temperament of a little puppy and will beg for cuddles. If you are a happy spirit and give
    me affection, I am going to love you with my whole heart and be the perfect dog for you.</div>
