  <div class='description'>I am an experienced dog and almost resemble a lion. My name comes from my old days of
    passion and fire. Despite my age,
    I still enjoy going for walks and am well-behaved, although I also have nothing against a few breaks. I get along
    well
    with dogs my age, but the energy of younger dogs sometimes annoys me, and I won't hesitate to put them in their
    place.
    With
    humans, I am friendly and enjoy pets, but I also appreciate alone time to rest. My ideal owner would be relaxed and
    calm.</div>
