  <div class='description'>I am an affectionate dog who loves to give kisses. I live together with my family in the
    shelter and get along well with other dogs since I am very sociable. I will politely ask for cuddles
    and have no problem with waiting until I receive them. I squeal excitedly whenever a human enters my territory.
    I will always be happy to see you. I enjoy eating alone in my dog
    house and am protective of my food, but other than growling at the younger ones when they get too
    close to my dinner, I won't quarrel. I am a perfect family dog since I am used to caring for younger
    ones and like attention.</div>
