  <div class='description'>I am a 10-month-old female who has been growing up with my siblings and other dogs.
    That has made me sociable and pretty calm for my age, but I love to sit on
    your lap or just cuddle. I am currently on leash training, so that would need a little
    patience, but I am getting there and really enjoy exercise. Since I live in the shelter, I'm used to
    being outside and not in completely closed spaces for sleeping. I'm a gentle and sweet dog who will
    enjoy the presence of other dogs as well as having my own space, and I'm perfect for going on walks or staying in
    on the couch.</div>
