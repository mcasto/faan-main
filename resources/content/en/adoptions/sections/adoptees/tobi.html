  <div class='description'>I am one of five siblings and a medium-sized, ten-month-old male dog who is a little shy.
    Like my Spanish name, "Copa de
    nieve," indicates, I am bright white with a little pink nose. I am still scared of the leash but am learning
    to walk with it. I like cuddles and hugs a lot, but I'm not overeager for attention and enjoy alone time as well. In
    the
    shelter, my favorite spot is on top of the dog house, where I can where I can get a better view, and I also like
    watching and chasing flies as a result of my curiosity. I'm used to being with other dogs and get along well with
    them. Fun
    Fact:
    A guilty pleasure of mine is broccoli, which I prefer over anything. Once I warm up to you, I'll be a calm, loving
    dog who will enjoy both exercise and relaxing.</div>
