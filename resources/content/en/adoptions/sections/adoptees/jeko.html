  <div class='description'>I am the guard of the lower shelter and the only one who is completely free. Because of
    that, I enjoy a little bit of a special position and take pride in that, which makes me very
    protective of my territory and even a little picky with my food. I love lots of cuddles and grunt if
    you hit the right spots. Don't worry, I'm not growling, just enjoying, which my bright smile will also
    indicate. I also like squeezing myself through small spaces and standing between people's legs. If you
    give me attention, I'll be the happiest dog, but I am also fine with withdrawing myself to a quiet
    spot to rest.</div>
