  <div class='name text-xl font-semibold'>Sophie</div>
  <div class='description'>I am a medium-sized, mixed-breed, six-year-old dog who was rescued by my former owner from
    being chained and abused.
    Sadly, my owner now has had to return to the United States and couldn't take me with them. Since I was raised to be
    a
    well-behaved, social dog, I am now ready to find a new home and an owner to whom I can give all my love. Even though
    I
    had a rough start in life, I've grown up to be loving and sweet. I like being with other dogs and get along with
    them
    well, especially my best friend Maisey, with whom I have a strong bond. It isn't required for both of us to be
    adopted
    to the same home, but it would surely help us settle in our new home and get accustomed faster. I love all people,
    but
    especially children, which makes me the perfect family dog. I have a playful character, and my liveliness is paired
    with
    my affection in the perfect way to brighten up everyone's day. I am also spayed, vaccinated, and housebroken. This
    is a
    wonderful adoption for an instant companion and a loving best friend for the family, particularly if you are not
    looking
    forward to training a puppy. If you live within 4 hours of Cuenca, we will bring Sophie and/or Maisey to you as part
    of
    FAAN's adoption support for these two special girls.</div>
