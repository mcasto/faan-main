  <div class='description'>I am a medium-sized female dog and live with my daughter, Lola, in the shelter. I
    love gently hugging people as a greeting and enjoy attention. Some dogs don't match well with me, but
    I'm usually very well behaved and very affectionate. Energetic and relaxed at the same time, I am a
    perfect companion for any situation and love any type of exercise. My owner should be patient
    with me so they can fully gain my trust, but once I get attached, I'll be a loving and calm dog who
    will always comfort you and make you feel at home.</div>
