      FAAN's Pledge to Donors
    </div>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bequests to FAAN are used for organizational sustainability of the
        shelter unless designated for a specific FAAN
        program or service by the Donor. These funds are closely invested and
        allocated by agreement of both the
        combined FAAN Board & US Advisory Board.
      </li>
      <li>
        Upon receipt of a Legacy Intention, Donors will be recognized as members
        of FAAN's Legacy Society unless an
        anonymous donation is requested.
      </li>
    </ol>
