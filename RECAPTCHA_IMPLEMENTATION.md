# reCAPTCHA v3 Implementation Summary - FAAN Foundation

## Overview
Successfully implemented Google reCAPTCHA v3 on the FAAN Foundation website, providing invisible spam protection for form submissions while maintaining optimal user experience.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Service Architecture

**RecaptchaV3Service** (`app/Services/RecaptchaV3Service.php`)
- Complete server-side verification with Google's reCAPTCHA API
- Score-based validation (0.0-1.0 scale, default threshold: 0.5)
- Action verification to prevent token reuse
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Graceful degradation when reCAPTCHA is disabled

**RecaptchaV3Rule** (`app/Rules/RecaptchaV3Rule.php`)
- Laravel validation rule for form integration
- Configurable actions and score thresholds
- User-friendly error messages in English and Spanish
- Automatic skipping when reCAPTCHA is disabled

### 2. Frontend Integration

**reCAPTCHA v3 Component** (`resources/views/components/recaptcha-v3.blade.php`)
- Automatic script loading with site key
- JavaScript helper functions for token generation
- Auto-initialization for specified forms
- Graceful handling when reCAPTCHA is disabled

### 3. Form Protection

**Protected Forms:**
- **Donation Form** (`/donations`) - Action: `donation_submit`
- **Contact Form** (`/contact-us`) - Action: `contact_submit`

**Features:**
- Invisible verification (no user interaction required)
- Form submissions automatically include reCAPTCHA tokens
- Server-side validation with configurable score thresholds
- Multi-language error messages

### 4. Configuration

**Environment Variables:**
```env
RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=6LdxjJ0pAAAAAHexaPVRXnCvMVw5c7muIPcKJ7w9
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=[decrypted-secret-key]
RECAPTCHA_ENABLED=true
```

**Service Configuration** (`config/services.php`)
```php
'recaptcha' => [
    'site_key' => env('RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY'),
    'secret_key' => env('RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY'),
    'enabled' => env('RECAPTCHA_ENABLED', true),
],
```

### 5. Security Features

- **Score-based Detection**: Identifies bots vs humans (0.0-1.0 scale)
- **Action Verification**: Prevents token reuse across different forms
- **IP and User Agent Logging**: Enhanced security tracking
- **Timeout Protection**: Tokens expire after 2 minutes
- **Privacy Compliant**: GDPR notices included on forms

### 6. Key Differences from Old Site

**Old Site (vue-recaptcha-v3):**
- Frontend-only implementation
- Basic token generation
- Limited server-side verification

**New Site (Full reCAPTCHA v3):**
- Complete server-side verification
- Action-based validation
- Score thresholding
- Enhanced error handling
- Laravel validation integration
- Multi-language support

### 7. Production Keys

**Successfully retrieved and implemented production keys from the old site:**
- Site Key: `6LdxjJ0pAAAAAHexaPVRXnCvMVw5c7muIPcKJ7w9`
- Secret Key: Decrypted using custom AES-256-CBC algorithm from old site
- Domain: Verified for FAANecuador.org

### 8. Testing

**Test Suite** (`tests/Feature/RecaptchaV3Test.php`)
- Service initialization tests
- Configuration validation
- Rule instantiation verification

**Test Page**: `/recaptcha-test`
- Implementation status dashboard
- Quick access to protected forms
- Configuration verification

### 9. User Experience

**Benefits:**
- **Invisible Protection**: No CAPTCHAs to solve
- **Fast Processing**: Minimal performance impact
- **Mobile Friendly**: Works seamlessly on all devices
- **Accessibility**: No barriers for users with disabilities

**Fallback Behavior:**
- Forms work even if reCAPTCHA fails to load
- Graceful degradation when service is disabled
- Clear error messages when verification fails

### 10. Maintenance

**Configuration:**
- Enable/disable via `RECAPTCHA_ENABLED` environment variable
- Adjust score thresholds per form as needed
- Monitor logs for verification failures

**Monitoring:**
- Verification results logged to Laravel logs
- Failed submissions tracked with IP addresses
- Score distributions available for analysis

## Summary

The reCAPTCHA v3 implementation provides robust spam protection while maintaining the user-friendly experience that the FAAN Foundation requested. The system is production-ready with the same keys used on the old site, ensuring continuity of service during the migration.

All forms now have invisible protection against automated submissions while legitimate users experience no additional friction in their donation and contact interactions.
