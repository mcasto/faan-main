## Monday.com Integration Analysis

### **Infrastructure Discovered (Not In Use)**
The old site contained comprehensive Monday.com API integration infrastructure but was **NOT actively using it** for contact or donation forms:

#### **Available but Unused Components:**
- **Monday.com API Wrapper**: Complete `Castoware\Monday.php` GraphQL client
- **Board Management**: Tools for creating and managing Monday.com boards
- **Test Boards Configured**: 3 test boards (Donations, Donors, Contacts) with column mappings
- **Admin Interface**: Board creation and management tools in admin section

#### **Actual Production Flow (Old Site):**
1. ✅ Store form data in database (encrypted)
2. ✅ Send email via SendGrid 
3. ✅ Log SendGrid response in database
4. ❌ **NO Monday.com integration in contact/donation forms**

#### **New Site Equivalency:**
1. ✅ Store form data in database (structured, improved)
2. ✅ Send email via SendGrid (enhanced templates)
3. ✅ Log SendGrid response in database (complete audit trail)
4. ❌ **NO Monday.com integration needed** (matches old site production behavior)

### **Conclusion: No Missing Functionality**
The Monday.com infrastructure was development/administrative tooling that wasn't used in the actual website forms. The new site has **full functional parity** with the old site's production behavior.

## Current Status

✅ **Framework Migration**: 100% complete Quasar to Tailwind conversion  
✅ **Navigation UX**: Enhanced with proper cursor indicators
